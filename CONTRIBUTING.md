# How to contribute.

We love pull requests from everyone.

Follow README.md to clone and run repo locally. Ensure tests pass.

Push to your fork (or a branch in this repo if you have such access)
and [submit a pull request][pr].
Ensure to use a meaningfull dashed name for your branch with a number of
the issue you are solving prepended. (e.g. `123-my-cool-feature`)

Keep in mind that single PR == single feature. We'll not allow having this
stuff messed up!
Also bear in mind to separate refactoring, code style, indentation change
commits from commits related to the feature directly.

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests
within three business days (and, typically, one business day). We may suggest
some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests.
* Follow our style guide.
* Write a [good commit message][commit].

-----------------------------------------------

## Getting Started.

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
* Fork the repository on GitHub (or create a branch if you have write access)

## Making Changes.

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the master branch.
  * Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that
    branch.
  * To quickly create a topic branch based on master; `git checkout -b
    fix/master/my_contribution master`. Please avoid working directly on the
    `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Ensure you're installed `pre-commit` check into your local repo
* Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format.

    [Issue #1234] Make the example in CONTRIBUTING imperative and concrete

    Without this patch applied the example commit message in the CONTRIBUTING
    document is not a concrete example.  This is a problem because the
    contributor is left to imagine what the commit message should look like
    based on a description rather than an example.  This patch fixes the
    problem by making the example concrete and imperative.

    The first line is a real life imperative statement with a ticket number
    from our issue tracker.  The body describes the behavior without the patch,
    why this is a problem, and how the patch fixes the problem when applied.

* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
* Run _all_ the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.
